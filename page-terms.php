                                    <li>A User may request to participate, in a repetitive, fixed and consecutive manner, in a certain lottery (or lotteries) chosen by the User (the Subscriber). Upon making such a request, the Company&apos;s confirmation of such request, and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Subscriber will participate automatically in the lottery (or lotteries) chosen and in the manner specified by the Subscriber. The basic subscription period is a month (the "Basic Period"), but the Subscriber may subscribe for longer periods of time (the "Long Period", and together with the Basic Period &mdash; the "Period"). Once the Period has ended, the subscription will auto-renew for Basic Periods each time, unless the Subscriber provides a notice in accordance with Section 6.4 or opts for a Long Period subscription.</li>
                                    <li>The Subscriber&apos;s User Account, or the means of payment provided by the Subscriber, will be debited for the Tickets that the Subscriber has requested to be purchased on his/her behalf (according to that Subscriber&apos;s subscription), at the sum equivalent to the Consideration. It is hereby clarified that such sum may change, and may not be the same as at the date in which the Subscriber opted for the subscription, in which case You will be notified of such change prior to charging You with the changed consideration. In case in which the Subscriber&apos;s User Account balance is less than the Consideration (for any reason whatsoever; including, but not limited to, any limits placed by the Subscriber), or that the means of payment provided by the Subscriber cannot be debited for the Consideration in whole or in part, then the subscription may, at the Company&apos;s sole discretion, be postponed (and no Ticket will be purchased on behalf of the Subscriber) until the Subscriber&apos;s User Account is replenished with sufficient funds or the means of payment provided by the Subscriber can be debited for the Consideration (and in respect of the latter - it is Your responsibility to inform the Company accordingly, and the Company is under no obligation to re-check whether the means of payment can be debited accordingly). The Company is under no obligation to notify the Subscriber of any such occurrence, and it is the sole liability of the Subscriber to confirm that the Subscriber&apos;s User Account has sufficient funds to pay the Consideration, or that the means of payment provided by the Subscriber can be debited to pay the Consideration, in accordance with the subscription. The Subscriber hereby releases, indemnifies and holds Us harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses arising from the postponement of the subscription.</li>
                                    <li>The Subscriber may cancel the subscription by sending an email to that effect to support@jinnilotto.com at least 5 business days prior to the next monthly cycle of the subscription (the "Notice Period"), for the cancellation to enter into force in respect of the next monthly cycle (and the following cycles, if applicable); failure to provide the cancellation notice prior to the Notice Period will result in charging the Subscriber for the next monthly cycle of the subscription. It is the Subscriber&apos;s responsibility to confirm that the cancellation notice was received by the Company, and We will not be liable for any direct or indirect loss or damage caused due to not receiving such a cancellation notice. In case in which the Subscriber cancels a subscription for which the Subscriber has received some kind of benefit from the Company (including, but not limited to, a discount for multiple and/or Long Period subscriptions and/or a present), the Company will charge the Subscriber for such benefits upon cancellation of the subscription. For the removal of doubt, no refund will be provided for subscriptions cancelled in respect of past and present Periods and/or past and present cycles, as well as for future cycle where the cancellation notice was not provided prior to the Notice Period.</li>

The provisions of this section do not derogate from the provisions of sections 4.7 and 4.8.</li>
                                    <li>It is hereby clarified that the numbers to be used in connection with the Program could change at the Company&apos;s sole discretion.

                                    <li>Where possible, the Company will allow You to request to choose certain characteristics of the Ticket (e.g., the numbers to be chosen for the purposes of that Ticket&apos;s participation in the lottery draw), subject to the availability of such characteristics in the lottery draw in connection with which the Ticket is purchased and subject to the availability of such an option provided by the Company.</li>

                                    <li>Once the Ticket is purchased, it will be held and stored by the Company.

It is hereby clarified that the recording of Your request to purchase the Ticket does not amount to a purchase of a Ticket (and the Ticket is confirmed to be purchased only after a scanned copy of the Ticket will be delivered to you via email or available in Your User Account), and We will not be held liable in connection with any such request where the Ticket was not purchased (or was purchased using other characteristics than the ones You asked for &mdash; including where the characteristics chosen by You appeared on the Website), including (but not limited to) where such occurrence was due to human and/or technical errors and/or failures. It is Your sole responsibility to confirm that a Ticket was purchased according to Your request (including, but not limited to, the relevant characteristics).</li>
                                    <li>Without derogating from the provisions of section 8.5, it is hereby clarified that all requests to purchase a Ticket must be made at least 24 hours prior to the time of the lottery game or draw in respect of which the request to purchase a Ticket was made (the 24 Hours Period) where the lottery game or draw is played and/or performed during or adjacent to a national holiday, bank holiday or any other day which is not a business day in the jurisdiction in which the Ticket applicable to that lottery game or draw is purchased, then the 24 Hours Period shall commence 24 hours prior to the beginning of such national holiday, bank holiday or any other day which is not a business day, and will also include the period of such national holiday, bank holiday or any other day which is not a business day. The Company is under no obligation to purchase any Ticket if the request to purchase such Ticket was made during the 24 Hours Period. Without derogating from the above, the Company may purchase a Ticket if the request to purchase it was made during the 24 Hours Period, but is under no obligation to do so. If a Ticket was not purchased due to the fact that the request to purchase it was made during the 24 Hours Period, the Company will purchase a similar (as far as possible) Ticket for the next lottery game or draw.</li>
                                    <li>Without derogating from any other provision of this Agreement, where the Ticket was not purchased, the Company may, at its sole discretion, provide You with an alternative service aimed at securing Your enjoyment from the participation in the lottery draw; this will be performed by providing You with an equivalent product to the Ticket which will ensure that You will receive the exact same benefits as if the Ticket was purchased. For the avoidance of doubt, this service will be operated and implemented at the Company&apos;s sole discretion in select instances. It is hereby clarified that the consideration to be paid for such service will be the same as the Consideration.</li>

Without derogating from the above, You hereby acknowledge that in some instances, the Operator may require You to collect the Winnings in person from the Operator at the Operator&apos;s jurisdiction (or any other place) or require You to perform any other act in person; in which case you hereby absolve Us of any obligation and/or duty to collect the Winnings, and it is Your responsibility to collect such Winnings (including, but not limited to, bear all costs and/or expenses associated with such collection).</li>

Your balance in Your User Account will be updated only after (and in accordance with) the payment of Winnings by the Operator. For this purpose, You acknowledge that taxes, levies and duties may be withheld or paid from the Winnings, either by the Operator or by the Company.

            <h3>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING </h3>
            <p>Jinni Lotto does not tolerate money laundering and supports the fight against money launderers. Jinni Lotto follows the guidelines set by&nbsp;the UK&rsquo;s Joint Money Laundering Steering Group. The UK&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;full member of&nbsp;the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the intergovernmental body whose purpose is&nbsp;to&nbsp;combat money laundering and terrorist financing.</p> 
            <p>Jinni Lotto now has policies in&nbsp;place to&nbsp;deter people from laundering money. These policies include:</p> 
            <ul class="uMText">
            <li>ensuring clients have valid proof of&nbsp;identification </li>
            <li>maintaining records of&nbsp;identification information </li>
            <li>determining that clients are not known or&nbsp;suspected terrorists by&nbsp;checking their names against lists of&nbsp;known or&nbsp;suspected terrorists</li> 
            <li>informing clients that the information they provide may be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;verify their identity </li>
            <li>closely following clients&rsquo; money transactions </li>
            <li>Not accepting cash, money orders, third party transactions, exchange houses transfers or&nbsp;Western Union transfers. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Money laundering occurs when funds from an&nbsp;illegal/criminal activity are moved through the financial system in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way as&nbsp;to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;appear that the funds have come from legitimate sources.</p> 
            <p>Money Laundering usually follows three stages:</p>
            <ul class="uMText">
            <li>firstly, cash or&nbsp;cash equivalents are placed into the financial system </li>
            <li>secondly, money is&nbsp;transferred or&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;other accounts (e.g. futures accounts) through a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;financial transactions designed to&nbsp;obscure the origin of&nbsp;the money (e.g. executing trades with little or&nbsp;no&nbsp;financial risk or&nbsp;transferring account balances to&nbsp;other accounts) </li>
            <li>And finally, the funds are re-introduced into the economy so&nbsp;that the funds appear to&nbsp;have come from legitimate sources (e.g. closing a&nbsp;futures account and transferring the funds to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bank account). </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Trading accounts are one vehicle that can be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;launder illicit funds or&nbsp;to&nbsp;hide the true owner of&nbsp;the funds. In&nbsp;particular, a&nbsp;trading account can be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;execute financial transactions that help obscure the origins of&nbsp;the funds. </p>
            <p>Jinni Lotto directs funds withdrawals back to&nbsp;the original source of&nbsp;remittance, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;preventative measure. </p>
            <p>International Anti-Money Laundering requires financial services institutions to&nbsp;be&nbsp;aware of&nbsp;potential money laundering abuses that could occur in&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer account and implement a&nbsp;compliance program to&nbsp;deter, detect and report potential suspicious activity. </p>
